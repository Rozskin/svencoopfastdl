This model was an extensive skin and animate effort based on a public domain 3D model by Tanya_Ekberg
https://sketchfab.com/Tanya_Ekberg which was a free model under the Creative Commons Attribution
creativecommons.org/license Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

All of the graphics work was done using Faststone Image Viewer, Microsoft Office Picture Manager, 
Microsoft Imager2 and any other tool that let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and other related work was done in Milkshape 1.8.5. with initial conversion from a 
raw 3d model using Blender 2.83.

The skeleton and all animations are from stock Sven-Coop player models, all credit to Valve and the Sven-Coop Team for those components.

The total effort took around a month elapsed time and a couple of weeks of effort.
